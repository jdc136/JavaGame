# JavaGame
A game coded in Java.

## Possible Games
- Checkers
- Tic-tac-toe
- [Chess](https://github.com/j21wang/terminal-chess/tree/master/Chess%202)
- [Pong](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120e/hw/SwingGame/index.html)
- [21 Sticks ](https://www.java-made-easy.com/fun-java-game.html)
- [Hangman](https://faculty.washington.edu/joelross/courses/archive/f13/cs161/hwk/7/)

I am personally leaning toward hangman. I believe it meets all our requirements. We could beef it up too with a database connection (for the words) and do some interesting stuff on the terminal side of things.

I am not sure about the other ones. 21 Sticks could be interesting, Pong would be quite challenging. Tic tac toe is one I have done in JavaScript a while back, but not sure if it's complicated enough. I can look at that code though. Chess seems really tough. Checkers could work.

## Resources

### UML Activity Diagram
Our UML activity diagram can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/2ea8ee9a-7a3a-4c1e-9074-cea0f76e0fee). Send me your email in Canvas and I will give you permission to edit it.

When you set up Lucid Chart, make sure you are setting it up with your student account. Otherwise, you'll only get to make a couple of charts. The school license gives us an unlimited number of documents.

### Markdown
[Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a resource regarding the use of Markdown, which is the code for this README.

### Git (Version Control)
There are several ways to install and use Git. Below I list some methods.

1. Go to the [git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Probably the easiest way, install [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. In either case, you'll still need to integrate Git with your editor. If you're using NetBeans, [this link](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html) provides some information
4. Easier might be to use Visual Studio Code (that's what I use)

    a. Download and install VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    
    b. See using VS Code with Git [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)

5. Once you're up and using Git, I'd recommend looking over this [tutorial video](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git) and this [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) - in fact, those may be useful to look at initially. There is also [this "visual" cheat sheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html). Last but not least, [the documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) may prove helpful for in depth explanations
