# Meetings
Purpose: To summarize our meetings for this project.

## Saturday, April 18th
- Allison and Jared looked together at the possible options put together
- It was decided that Hangman would be best option, as it is a challenging yet feasible game
- That being said, realized that it was a bit more involved that originally thought - however, couldn't turn back!
- With some help from online resources planned out the main parts of the program and divied up "pebbles"
