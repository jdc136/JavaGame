# Meetings
Purpose: To summarize our meetings for this project.
Collaborators: Jared Collier and Allison Roldan
Project: Java Game - Hangman

## Saturday, April 18th
- Allison and Jared looked together at the possible options put together
- It was decided that Hangman would be best option, as it is a challenging yet feasible game
- That being said, realized that it was a bit more involved that originally thought - however, couldn't turn back!
- With some help from online resources planned out the main parts of the program and divied up the "pebbles"
    - Allison will do the outside facing tasks
    - Jared will do the initial pseudocode and method stubbing
- planned to revisit tomorrow, Sunday April 19th

## Sunday, April 19th
- Discussed next steps and outlined pebbles a bit mroe
- Looked at the Agile board together on GitHub
- Jared followed up by saying he would work on getting the initial connection (constructor initialization) set up and then look to get a randomized word selected
- Allison's specific method tasks to follow shortly thereafter
